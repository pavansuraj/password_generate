### Documentation:
#### Design Choices:
a. **Function Naming:**
      - Renamed functions to follow the snake_case naming convention.
 b. **Enhanced Loop Variables:**
      - Used `_` as a loop variable where the loop variable is not used in the loop body.
 c. **Print Formatting:**
      - Used f-strings for better readability in print statements
 d. **Conditionals:**
      - Simplified conditionals for password length checking.
#### Challenges Faced:
   a. **Loop Variable Naming:**
      - Ensuring meaningful names for loop variables and avoiding conflicts.
   b. **Function Reusability:**
      - Ensuring that functions are modular and reusable for better code maintenance.
### Testing:
Thoroughly test the code by running various scenarios:
   - Generating passwords with different lengths.
   - Replacing characters with numbers and uppercase letters.
   - Handling edge cases.
Fix any identified bugs or issues during testing.
### Conclusion:
The implemented code adheres to best coding practices, readability, and improved functionality. This documentation provides insights into design choices, challenges faced, and the rationale behind the code structure.
